# GBemulator

Gameboy Emulator written from scratch in Rust. This is currently nowhere near a fully functional emulator. 
I'm developing this just for fun and educational purposes. Come back a little later ;)

## Status

### Working
* Implemented first instructions
* Basic Background rendering is working
* Basic Sprite rendering is working
* Tetris Splash Screen is shown and the demos are working

### Still missing
* A lot of CPU instructions
* Switching the background map/set
* Sprite options
* MBC
* Interrupts (currently only V-Blank works)
* Input
* Sound
* Proper graphics output (current implementation is very inefficient)
* GUI
* Probably a lot i forgot
